# Web Testing Tools Comparison Project

## Project Purpose
The web-testing-comparison project aims to compare different tools and frameworks for testing web applications. We evaluate tools such as Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, TestCafe, Puppeteer, and Nightwatch.js, and analyze their features, advantages, and drawbacks.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following parts:
- **selenium**: Contains test files for the Selenium framework.
- **cypress**: Contains test files for the Cypress framework.
- **playwright**: Contains test files for the Playwright framework.
- **testcafe**: Contains test files for the TestCafe framework.
- **puppeteer**: Contains test files for the Puppeteer framework.
- **nightwatch**: Contains test files for the Nightwatch.js framework.
- **comparison-reports**: Here you'll find comparison reports and test results.
- **README.md**: This file with general information about the project.
